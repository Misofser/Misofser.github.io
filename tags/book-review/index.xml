      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about what made a visionary company truly visionary, and what sets it apart from slightly less successful competitors?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m not into those “10 steps to guaranteed success” books - you know, the ones that insist that waking up at 5 AM and believing in yourself is the secret to solving all of life’s problems. But &lt;em&gt;Build to Last by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras&lt;/em&gt; was recommended to me by a person whose opinion I really value, and I didn’t regret reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review of Shape Up Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters: Key Insights</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I finished reading &lt;em&gt;Shape Up Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters&lt;/em&gt; by Ryan Singer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book teaches how to shape work and run projects effectively. I like that the book is full of concrete examples showing how 37signals works on real projects. It’s enjoyable to read because you can see how things actually happened. It&amp;rsquo;s not too long and not overly detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to share some of the concepts described in the book that I liked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
